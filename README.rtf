My solution in C for the Scheduler lab given in the Operating Systems class at NYU CAS Fall 2019.

This is my Scheduler in C. To run from the terminal do the following:\

Compile: 
gcc scheduler.c

Run with the input file you want from 1 to 7 by typing the following command:
./a.out  --verbose <input-filenumber>

TADA! The output will be printed
